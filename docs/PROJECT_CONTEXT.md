## 11 August 2026 — current A3 engineering baseline entering documentation closeout

The A3 engineering baseline entering closeout is GitHub `main` `1060e60d3affadabdf97924c7ece85cc62d8e360`, merge of A3-SC-1 Small Stale-Code Cleanup PR #116 from reviewed head `097fabb6065afc4c322238985eb7f237a503a7c3`. The reviewed tree contains **868 tests, 868 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 cancelled**. Permanent post-merge Verify Teamsheet run #194 / `31470879289` passed the repository gate on that exact merge commit, and GitHub Pages run #120 / `31470878300` succeeded for the same commit.

A3 engineering remediation is complete through PR #116. This documentation/architecture reconciliation is the final A3 closeout layer; no A3-specific engineering or documentation task follows it. No application, test, build, generated-deployable, model, provider, persistence-format or product implementation change is part of this closeout.

Route-Aware Rendering and Performance M1 is complete through PR #115 and remains measurement-only. It demonstrated real avoidable inactive-route work without demonstrating material user-visible lag. **Route-aware optimisation is not approved.** See [Route-Aware Rendering and Performance](ROUTE-AWARE-RENDERING-PERFORMANCE.md).

A3-SC-1 removed only `renderLeagueChips()` and `rememberLeague()` plus stale test-side consumers and added structural regressions. No physical iPhone testing was performed or claimed for PR #116. The brittle `selectMiniLeague` exact-source-string assertion remains separate deferred test-hardening debt. See [A3-SC-1 Small Stale-Code Cleanup](A3-SC-1-SMALL-STALE-CODE-CLEANUP.md).

## Historical — 10 August 2026 baseline after A3 State-Ownership Cleanup

GitHub `main` was `691d9f929284d51c233b61d099c34cafe1030db6`, merge of A3 State-Ownership Cleanup PR #112 from reviewed head `620daf14d1c354668b16df74daf05e29d8a1eb25`.

A3 State-Ownership Cleanup is complete, merged and accepted. It declares the legitimate cross-module `S` slots centrally in `src/state.mjs` without making that module the semantic owner of every value, makes the legacy `S.leagues` Mini-League compatibility alias one-way so `S.miniLeagues` remains canonical, and adds focused ownership regressions. It is deliberately not a general state-management rewrite. No model, provider, persistence-format, error-boundary, Atomic Foreground Refresh, routing-performance or bundler behaviour changed.

The exact-main post-merge Verify Teamsheet run #167 / `31430700053` passed **864 tests, 864 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 cancelled**, together with committed deployment provenance, complete production build, deterministic rebuild, root/deployable equality, exact build identity and production-output preservation. GitHub Pages deployment run #117 / `31430697347` also succeeded on that exact merge commit. No physical iPhone testing was performed for PR #112 and none is claimed.

At that checkpoint the next substantive work was **Route-Aware Rendering and Performance**, beginning with investigation and measurement only. Its M1 measurement stage has since merged through PR #115; optimisation remains unapproved, as recorded in the current-baseline section above.

## Historical checkpoint snapshot — before PR #108 merge: A3 Error-Boundary Separation

**Historical only; superseded by the current baseline above.**

GitHub `main` was `d112c673310149a4463def1758242460450600dc`, merge of PR #107. Push-triggered Verify Teamsheet run #127 / `31396393124` succeeded with **842 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 cancelled** plus committed provenance, deterministic rebuild, build identity and production-artifact preservation. The `fpl:calib` compatibility checkpoint was complete and PERSIST-4 closed: unverified stored calibration remained byte-preserved but inert and standard uncalibrated projections remained active.

Pritesh had approved A3 Error-Boundary Separation Package EB-1 for implementation. Draft PR #108 was current. The candidate fixed two proven ownership defects without changing provider acquisition policy: a recovery-render exception could no longer disappear behind a real Official FPL collection failure, and an unexpected supporting-layer computation exception could no longer be manufactured into Understat/Odds provider degradation. Existing provider failures, Rule-B supporting-value retain/clear behaviour, Atomic Foreground Refresh rollback and PR #104 persistence semantics were preserved. Unexpected refresh-lifecycle exceptions received fixed application copy without mutating Provider Health or installing a global swallow boundary.

Candidate evidence at that point was **856 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 cancelled** over the 842-test `main` baseline, with all 842 retained and none weakened; committed deployment provenance from reachable source; two byte-identical production builds with root `index.html` equal to `dist/index.html`; exact manifest build identity. Physical acceptance and merge were still outstanding at that snapshot; both are now complete as recorded in repository history.

## 10 August 2026 — PR #103 physical acceptance closeout

The final Small Mobile UI Consistency + Loading Viewport Fix application source is `646eee13960c343fbe07e3a76496717fd9837c0e`, with generated-only child `81cc9130ac2c7b8206f3bd5f6a2cf85bb5ba0777`. The final candidate retains every prior test and passes **803 tests, 0 failed**, deterministic byte-identical builds, root/deployable equality, exact build identity and reachable generated provenance. Permanent Verify Teamsheet run #90 / `31356255017` passed on the exact generated head.

Physical iPhone Safari acceptance is complete: the startup canvas reaches Safari chrome without a light strip; Team, Transfers, Fixtures, Leagues and Settings use the accepted shared header hierarchy; the refined editable/selectable controls are visually proportionate while retaining the no-focus-zoom behaviour; and the Leagues primary box now aligns vertically with the other primary screens. Pritesh explicitly approved PR #103 for merge on 10 August 2026.

No projection, expected-minutes, scoring, fixture, captaincy, squad, transfer, rank, Mini-League/rival, provider, data-source, Atomic Foreground Refresh, navigation, Team-renderer or Player Detail behaviour changed. At documentation closeout, GitHub `main` remained `d5f2572ee4d95c3c242ecbc97ee46802a6f0273d`; the eventual merge commit must be read from latest `main` rather than inferred from this pre-merge documentation commit.

## Historical checkpoint — after PR #104 merge

**A3 Cache & Persistence Resilience was merged.** GitHub `main` at that point was `9b31f373a23d26c49f81c688a2ca6fde98086cbd`, the merge of PR #104. Small mobile UI consistency PR #103, Atomic Foreground Refresh PR #102 and the D1 design closeout PR #101 were merged before it.

PR #104's reviewed head was `4e434b940e2bcb473374573db5da16f6a645d9eb`, over source/test commit `502a1f7ac0e0456743f3ddb0695433decf8976d1` and generated-only child `02216b8`. It passes **832 tests, 0 failed**, verified committed build provenance, deterministic byte-identical builds and root/deployable equality, with permanent Verify Teamsheet run #105 / `31377157889` on the reviewed head. Physical iPhone acceptance was **explicitly waived by Pritesh**; none was performed and none is claimed.

The work that followed was post-A3 Checkpoint 0 housekeeping, then 0C, `fpl:calib` compatibility, EB-1, Production-Bundle Safeguards, State-Ownership Cleanup, Route-Aware M1 and A3-SC-1. Those engineering checkpoints are now complete; see the current baseline above and [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## 9 August 2026 D1 closeout

At that closeout the authoritative baseline was `main` `6e725485564a51ee2a17bc08e5c8bf95e8c2778c`, merge of PR #100; it has since been superseded — see the current baseline above. The iPhone form-focus zoom correction passed 693 tests and physical iPhone Safari acceptance and is complete.

[Data Architecture D1](DATA-ARCHITECTURE-D1.md) is an approved design, not an implementation. It selects D1 plus private R2 behind a separate authenticated data Worker, retains local fallback, and limits Google Sheets to optional downstream reporting. The engineering checkpoint that followed it, Atomic Foreground Refresh, is now merged; D1 implementation itself remains separately approval-gated.

Purpose: current product and engineering state. Audience: every session after `CLAUDE.md`. Last reconciled: 11 August 2026.

Related: [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md), [Decisions](DECISIONS.md), [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md), [Known Limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md), [Teamsheet 2.0 Product Blueprint](TEAMSHEET2-PRODUCT-BLUEPRINT.md), [Historical Records](HISTORICAL_RECORDS.md).

## Outcome

Teamsheet is a strongly verified FPL decision product. The complete Teamsheet 2.0 migration, owner-controlled Official FPL gateway, exact persistent Transfers work, Team, Player Detail, Fixtures, Leagues pre-season acceptance, Repository Truth A1, Safe Hygiene A2, Refresh-Load R1, Audit A3, A3-R0, DTR-1, the iPhone form-focus zoom correction, the Data Architecture D1 design closeout, Atomic Foreground Refresh, the small mobile UI consistency checkpoint, A3 cache and persistence resilience, Post-A3 Checkpoint 0/0C, `fpl:calib` compatibility, A3 Error-Boundary Separation, A3 Production-Bundle Safeguards, A3 State-Ownership Cleanup, Route-Aware M1 and A3-SC-1 are merged. **A3 engineering remediation is complete, and this documentation/architecture reconciliation is the final A3 closeout layer. No A3-specific engineering or documentation task follows it.** No formula, recommendation or new-provider checkpoint is approved.

Refresh-Load R1 changed acquisition cadence only: valid detailed histories, normalised Understat team inputs and key-free derived Odds inputs can be reused without repeating their network requests. Atomic foreground-state replacement is merged through PR #102. EB-1 changes failure ownership only. Production-Bundle Safeguards changes test/harness coverage only. State-Ownership Cleanup clarifies shared-state inventory and removes reverse authority from the legacy Mini-League alias only. Route-Aware M1 changes measurement tooling only. A3-SC-1 removes proven-unreachable code only. Understat parser repair and model/data-source expansion remain separately gated. Real minute-history reuse, Stage 10 outcome capture and populated Leagues behaviour still require a completed, officially `data_checked` Gameweek and begin with investigation/evidence only.

## Historical evidence baseline — before PR #107 merge

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Repository head | GitHub `main` `9b31f373a23d26c49f81c688a2ca6fde98086cbd`, merge of A3 cache and persistence resilience PR #104 |
| Latest merged application checkpoint | PR #104, reviewed head `4e434b940e2bcb473374573db5da16f6a645d9eb`, source `502a1f7ac0e0456743f3ddb0695433decf8976d1` with generated-only child `02216b8` |
| Application tree | The reviewed PR #104 tree is preserved by the merge |
| Permanent automated baseline | PR #104 Verify Teamsheet run #105 / `31377157889` on reviewed head `4e434b9`: 832 passed, 0 failed. The merge commit received no automatic run, because `verify.yml` did not trigger on pushes to `main`; Checkpoint 0A corrects that for future merges. |
| Generated application baseline | PR #104 reproduced committed deployables from reachable source before the test build; double builds were byte-identical and root equalled deployable. Independently reproduced locally at the merge commit `9b31f373…`. |
| Current unmerged candidate | Post-A3 Checkpoint 0 housekeeping on `claude/teamsheet-post-a3-closeout-crqojj`: CI trigger correction, documentation reconciliation and the 0C investigation. No application runtime source change. |
| Deployment architecture | Static GitHub Pages single-file app plus a separate owner-controlled Cloudflare Worker for allowlisted read-only Official FPL transport |
| Approval boundary | D1 design is approved and documented, but D1/R2/Worker persistence implementation is not. PR #104 hardened browser-side persistence only and left `fpl:calib` untouched. The `fpl:calib` compatibility and resilience checkpoint was next at this historical point; it and error-boundary separation are now merged. |

## Physical iPhone Safari baseline

Pritesh has physically accepted the tested populated paths for:

- Transfers, including the six-Gameweek exact calculation, result persistence, cancellation/restart, app switching, stale-result protection and **No hit** wording;
- Player Detail scrolling, rotation, background restoration and dock layering;
- Team startup ownership, availability presentation, reserve-goalkeeper bench position and outfield bench order;
- Fixtures horizontal scrolling and remaining-season horizons through GW38;
- the Leagues all-league hub, league selection/switching, primary persistence, back navigation, pre-season standings/exposure states and Official FPL versus manually added league management.

Atomic Foreground Refresh (PR #102) and the small mobile UI consistency checkpoint (PR #103) additionally have completed physical iPhone Safari acceptance on their merged builds.

EB-1 (PR #108) additionally passed physical iPhone Safari acceptance for normal online startup, manual online refresh, in-app offline refresh retaining saved verified data, and return-online recovery. The clean uncached private-tab offline-first application state could not be exercised because Safari itself could not load the static Pages shell while offline; that path remains automated-only evidence. The incomplete manual squad used during acceptance means recommendation-survival was not independently observed on device.

Do not generalise those checks beyond the recorded paths. [Leagues pre-season acceptance](LEAGUES-PRESEASON-ACCEPTANCE.md) is authoritative. A3 cache and persistence resilience has **no** physical device evidence because testing was explicitly waived for that checkpoint. A3 State-Ownership Cleanup, Route-Aware M1 and A3-SC-1 also have **no** physical device evidence; none is claimed for those non-visual/measurement/cleanup checkpoints.

Refresh-Load R1's first PR #96 device pass additionally accepted online startup, exact build identity, short background return, Provider Health, manual refresh, cached repeat launch and in-app offline resilience. It exposed one merge blocker: an offline in-app refresh could be described as newly loaded/live when Safari satisfied gateway requests from HTTP cache. The corrected build prevents network acquisition when Safari definitively reports offline, preserves the saved snapshot and labels FPL Fallback. Pritesh physically retested and accepted that exact path, then verified the accepted build identity after Pages returned to `main`. A full offline hard reload cannot load the static Pages application shell and is explicitly outside R1.

## Deferred live-season acceptance

The following Leagues evidence requires real post-Gameweek Official FPL data and is deliberately deferred:

- published rank and movement;
- populated standings and points gaps;
- nearby-rival selection and pairwise comparison;
- selected-rival squad, captain, vice-captain and chip exposure;
- stale, incomplete and unavailable rival handling against real responses;
- relevant large-league targeted pagination.

These are evidence gaps, not current defects. Any issue found later must be investigated and scoped separately before implementation.

## Product purpose

Teamsheet helps an FPL manager make better decisions about their own complete 15-player squad. It is team-first rather than player-first and decision-first rather than data-first. The ordinary weekly workflow should answer:

1. What is my best XI, captain, vice-captain and bench order?
2. Should I roll, transfer or take a hit?
3. Which fixture runs matter to my current team and transfer plans?
4. Where do I stand in my leagues and how do explicitly selected rivals differ?
5. Is any data limitation material to the decision?

Technical diagnostics, evidence operations and advanced research remain available under Settings without dominating the primary workflow.

## Implemented information architecture

The deployed primary navigation is:

1. **Team**
2. **Transfers**
3. **Fixtures**
4. **Leagues**
5. **Settings**

Player Explorer lives under Settings → Research Tools. Ask Teamsheet has a global/Team route, but hosted AI is disabled because client-side Anthropic keys are prohibited. Free transfers and bank remain visible on Team and are currently manual inputs rather than proven authoritative account values.

## Implemented capability

### Team

- legal 15-player squad gating and a pitch-first connected/manual/restricted experience;
- deterministic best XI, captain, vice-captain and bench order;
- base-XI and captain-uplift forecast presentation;
- one material risk and advisory deadline action;
- session-only decision preview without FPL account writes.

### Transfers

- exact zero-to-three-transfer search over the approved eligible universe;
- mandatory zero-transfer comparison, complete squad legality, affordability, hits, free-transfer utility and roll value;
- application-scoped Web Worker calculation that survives internal navigation;
- independent reduced-pool exhaustive oracle and permanent exactness/performance guards.

### Fixtures

- blanks, doubles, difficulty lenses, run scores and swing windows;
- Official FPL overall-FDR fallback when strength inputs are unavailable;
- user-selected horizons bounded by the remaining season through GW38.

### Leagues

- all-league hub using already-loaded Official FPL membership facts;
- invitational/general/saved grouping and honest unpublished-rank handling;
- selected-league detail, targeted/incremental standings, pairwise rival comparison and at-most-five explicitly selected rival exposure;
- no full-league squad fan-out, projected rank, effective-ownership strategy or protect/chase recommendation.

### Settings and evidence

- Team & Account, Research Tools, Evidence & Performance, Data & Diagnostics and Help & About route groups;
- seven-state Provider Health and consequence-led core-data warnings;
- immutable pre-deadline snapshots, Official FPL outcomes, descriptive metrics and operating review;
- deterministic JSON, Markdown and eight CSV exports; Google Sheets remains a manual downstream destination.

## Engineering foundation

- Vanilla JavaScript ES modules; no framework and zero runtime dependencies.
- Node built-in tests and a custom deterministic bundler.
- `src/` plus `app.html` are canonical; `dist/` and root `index.html` are generated only by `build.mjs`.
- GitHub Pages serves the byte-identical root deployment copy.
- The Cloudflare gateway is transport-only and performs no account write, model computation or secret handling.
- Optional providers fail gracefully; Understat remains team-level and Odds remains direct-only.
- Validated supporting inputs use separate local caches; Understat raw HTML and Odds secrets are never stored in those caches.
- Stage 10 evidence flows one way from frozen prediction to outcome to evaluation to review and cannot feed back into live recommendations.
- `src/state.mjs` is the declared cross-module `S` slot inventory; domain modules remain the semantic owners of their own mutable state.

## Current product gaps

- No single synthesised weekly action across Team, Transfers and Fixtures.
- No validated projected-rank or tactical Mini-League strategy model.
- No cited team-news, predicted-line-up, press-conference, cup-congestion or travel intelligence.
- Bank and free transfers are not yet authoritative account-derived values.
- Hosted Ask Teamsheet remains unavailable.
- Prospective 2026/27 accuracy and calibration evidence has not yet accumulated.
- Google Sheets export is manual and the app cannot run guaranteed work while fully closed on iPhone.

## Current technical risks

- real post-Gameweek minute-history cache reuse and revision-triggered refresh have automated coverage but cannot yet have physical live-season evidence;
- the flattened bundle still depends on an explicit module order that is broader than the direct import graph, protected by PR #111's complete-bundle safeguards;
- browser persistence failure handling is proven by automated tests only; Teamsheet never installs a `window.storage` manager itself, so the authoritative-backend paths have no physical-device or real-host evidence;
- the shared-state inventory regression guards direct/static `S` property access but is not a general data-flow proof for arbitrary computed property access;
- browser automation cannot replace physical Safari layout and interaction evidence.

These are roadmap inputs, not authority to change them.

## Current and next

### Completed now

**Audit A3/A3-R0:** complete and merged through PR #98. **DTR-1:** complete and merged through PR #99. **iPhone form-focus zoom:** complete and merged through PR #100. **Data Architecture D1 design closeout:** merged through PR #101 as documentation only. **Atomic Foreground Refresh:** complete, physically accepted and merged through PR #102. **Small mobile UI consistency:** complete, physically accepted and merged through PR #103. **A3 cache and persistence resilience:** complete and merged through PR #104 with physical iPhone testing explicitly waived. **Post-A3 Checkpoint 0:** complete and merged through PR #105. **0C manual-squad dead-handler cleanup:** complete and merged through PR #106. **`fpl:calib` compatibility:** complete and merged through PR #107. **A3 Error-Boundary Separation (EB-1):** complete, physically accepted on the executable device paths, merged and post-merge verified through PR #108. **A3 Production-Bundle Safeguards:** complete and merged through PR #111 at `5a1a036…`, with exact-main 859/859 verification. **A3 State-Ownership Cleanup:** complete and merged through PR #112 at `691d9f9…`, with exact-main 864/864 post-merge verification and no physical device testing performed or claimed. **Route-Aware Rendering and Performance M1:** measurement instrumentation only, complete and merged through PR #115 at `02ea634…`, with exact-main 866/866 post-merge verification and no physical device testing performed or claimed. **A3-SC-1 Small Stale-Code Cleanup:** complete and merged through PR #116 at `1060e60…`, with reviewed-head 868/868 verification, successful exact-main post-merge verification and successful Pages deployment; no physical device testing was performed or claimed. **A3 documentation/architecture reconciliation:** this documentation-only package is the final A3 closeout layer; no further A3-specific task follows it.

### A3 closeout boundary

This documentation/architecture reconciliation records the final A3 state. It changes canonical wording only: no application source, tests, build inputs or generated deployables, and no later work is pulled into A3.

### Next substantive checkpoints

No later substantive checkpoint is automatically approved by A3 closeout. Route-aware optimisation remains unapproved. D1 persistence implementation, Understat repair, Odds API repair, ChatGPT migration, Cloudflare/agent expansion and richer external intelligence remain separately gated.

### After real Gameweek data

After the first completed and officially `data_checked` Gameweek, investigate real minute-history caching, Stage 10 outcome capture and populated Leagues data without changing calculations. Perform deferred Leagues acceptance and begin genuine Stage 10 evidence review. Investigate defects first; do not tune calculations or add football inputs from a small or unavailable sample.

## Non-negotiable limits

Refresh-Load R1 changes acquisition cadence and validated local persistence only. A3 cache and persistence resilience changes browser persistence compatibility, verification and disclosure only. `fpl:calib` compatibility rejects unverified stored calibration without introducing a methodology or tuned values. EB-1 changes failure ownership only. Production-Bundle Safeguards changes test/harness coverage only. State-Ownership Cleanup clarifies ownership and removes the Mini-League writable-alias ambiguity only. Route-Aware M1 changes measurement tooling only. A3-SC-1 removes proven-unreachable code only. None of those checkpoints authorises any new provider/source/endpoint, model, fixture, scoring, expected-minutes, squad, captaincy, simulation, transfer, rank, Mini-League intelligence, strategy, route-performance, navigation, D1 persistence, Cloudflare or Pages architecture change. Route-aware optimisation remains unapproved. Historical aggregate r=0.80 remains method-flattered and is not a validated accuracy claim.
