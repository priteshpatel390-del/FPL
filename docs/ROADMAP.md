# ROADMAP.md — current and proposed checkpoints

## Current sequence after D1 design approval

1. **Data Architecture D1 design — complete:** approved architecture is recorded in [DATA-ARCHITECTURE-D1.md](DATA-ARCHITECTURE-D1.md); no infrastructure or runtime implementation exists.
2. **Atomic Foreground Refresh — implemented, merge-gated:** design approved through R2/R3/R3.1/R3.2/R3.3/R3.4; implementation candidate on `claude/atomic-foreground-refresh-h7umfj`. Merge and physical iPhone acceptance remain owner-gated. See [Atomic Foreground Refresh](ATOMIC-FOREGROUND-REFRESH.md).
3. Cache and persistence resilience.
4. Error-boundary separation.
5. Production-bundle safeguards.
6. Documentation/state-ownership cleanup where appropriate.
7. Understat repair.
8. Odds API repair.
9. Approved D1 persistent historical/live implementation.
10. Route-aware rendering/performance work.
11. Claude-to-ChatGPT migration.
12. Cloudflare automation expansion.
13. AI agents and richer external intelligence.

Small stale-code cleanup remains low priority. Live-Gameweek evidence gates remain unchanged.

Purpose: open, next and deferred work only. Historical stage and merge records are indexed in [Historical Records](HISTORICAL_RECORDS.md). Last reconciled: 9 August 2026.

## Baseline

- Repository head at this checkpoint: `main` `deb4ea26ba96112dba07660e23a61f04d4b6596d` (D1 design closeout through PR #101).
- Latest substantive application checkpoint: DTR-1 PR #99, reviewed source `a15443f3de889561fd301c4aa1792d19f7b21c83`, generated head `b45f89baf45e12de09cdb1ad34826756e9e5378b`, merge `09e595c275b4f3614c09fb502291de6831813999`.
- Permanent repository verification: run `31301475598`; 691 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 cancelled; reachable-source reproduction; deterministic double build; root/deployable equality; exact source and complete build-input identity.
- Transfers, Player Detail, Team and Fixtures tested paths are physically accepted on iPhone Safari.
- Leagues is accepted for the currently available pre-season data. Populated post-Gameweek acceptance remains deferred, not failed.
- Refresh-Load R1 is merged, deployed from `main` and physically accepted for every currently testable iPhone path. Live minute-history reuse awaits a completed checked Gameweek; Odds reuse awaits an enabled Odds configuration.

## Current approved checkpoint — iPhone form-focus zoom correction

**Status:** narrow implementation candidate on `agent/iphone-form-focus-zoom`. Permanent CI, exact two-commit generated provenance, physical iPhone Safari acceptance and merge remain owner-gated.

**Scope:** render text, number, search, password, select and textarea controls at a minimum 16px so iPhone Safari does not auto-zoom on focus. Preserve browser pinch zoom and leave checkbox, file and range controls unchanged.

**Finalisation:** commit reviewed source/test/documentation changes first, build with that reachable commit as `BUILD_COMMIT`, then commit only the four generated deployables. Run permanent CI and physically verify focus, keyboard close, scale recovery and save behaviour on the exact PR build before owner merge approval.

**Exclusions:** disabling zoom through viewport restrictions; body typography changes; control redesign; calculation, provider, data source, cache, persistence, route, navigation, security-origin or dependency changes; D1 and later roadmap work.

**Evidence:** physical DTR-1 testing showed the resource field triggered strong Safari zoom and remained enlarged after the keyboard closed. Source inspection found the 15px inherited control size across the app and a separate 15px global search override. Focused regressions require every current text-entry control family to be 16px while rejecting viewport zoom suppression.

## Completed checkpoint — DTR-1 Direct Team renderer

**Status:** complete and merged through PR #99 at `09e595c275b4f3614c09fb502291de6831813999` after 691/691 permanent tests, exact generated provenance, deterministic builds, populated physical iPhone Safari acceptance and explicit owner approval.

DTR-1 replaced the legacy Team render/reconstruct boundary with one direct renderer while preserving the accepted design, calculations, providers, data sources, routes and persistence. Its exact-device pass exposed the separate pre-existing form-focus zoom issue now isolated above.

## Completed checkpoint — A3-R0 durable build provenance

**Status:** complete and merged through PR #98 at `5ee735f864aaea2b6c423dfaeb267f18f5fe3b2f`.

The generated manifest now carries complete build-input identity. CI requires the generating commit to be a reachable ancestor, verifies exact source inputs and reproduces committed deployables before ordinary builds overwrite them. Permanent run `31283849251` passed 685/685 with deterministic builds and root/deployable equality. No application behaviour changed.

## Completed checkpoint — Refresh-Load R1

**Status:** complete and merged through PR #96 at `2ddb33c81fa2092598f290d60320364f2e0c35dc`. The first iPhone pass exposed and bounded an offline-disclosure defect; corrected source `d1b6ac0…` passed exact remote verification and the focused device retest before owner-approved merge.

**Objective:** stop unchanged validated supporting inputs from being fetched again on every eligible startup/foreground cycle while preserving honest age, fallback and manual-refresh behaviour.

**Why it matters:** a connected live-season cycle can otherwise make roughly 102 requests, including 95 detailed histories, even when its seven-day cache is fresh. Optional outages also repeat retry latency and can consume Odds quota.

**Exact scope:**

- minute histories require matching schema/model/season, validated player entries, an unchanged finished-and-data-checked fixture revision and a maximum seven-day age;
- load the active connected or manual squad first, then the unchanged 80-player research cohort, requesting only missing/invalid/due players;
- stop after two completely failed four-player batches and never advance successful timestamps on failure;
- persist validated normalised Understat team inputs only, refresh after a completed match or 24 hours and use a six-hour automatic failure cooldown;
- persist validated key-free derived Odds inputs only, refresh hourly within 48 hours of a deadline/kickoff or six-hourly otherwise, and exclude inputs older than six hours;
- persist secret-free Odds cooldown state for rejected keys, quota exhaustion and transient failure;
- let manual Load Data and explicit optional-source setting changes bypass provider cooldowns;
- keep all seven Provider Health states and show detailed-minute age/cache use separately from core Official FPL freshness;
- reconcile merged A2 status and regenerate deployables only through `build.mjs`.

**Exclusions:** Understat parser repair/replacement; atomic foreground-state redesign; core bootstrap reduction; new provider/endpoint/origin; gateway change; formula, model, ranking or recommendation change; navigation redesign; golden change.

**Risks:** historical player corrections can arrive without a fixture revision, cached Odds may be up to one/six hours old, and cooldowns can delay automatic recovery. The seven-day backstop, six-hour maximum Odds use and manual bypass bound those risks.

**Test requirements:** all 667 prior tests plus request count/order, revision/age, missing-only refresh, outage guard, unchanged timestamp, Understat/Odds cadence/cache/cooldown/key-free persistence and manual-bypass coverage; deterministic double build, root/deployable equality, exact manifest identity and remote CI. No test or golden may be removed or weakened.

**Physical acceptance:** online startup, exact build identity, short background return, Provider Health, manual refresh, cached repeat launch and in-app offline resilience passed on iPhone Safari. The focused corrected-build retest also passed: FPL showed Fallback, explicit offline copy and the unchanged saved-data time, and the same accepted build identity was verified after Pages returned to `main`. Minute-history reuse cannot yet be physically exercised before a completed Gameweek; Odds reuse cannot be exercised while Odds is disabled. Full offline hard reload is outside R1 because the static Pages shell is not available without a service worker.

**Completion evidence:** exact remote head `967856246a0c17972c43eaf444651bceb8b9f728`, reviewed/merged tree `fd40deff72c458286e77f44a66b79a0e720e700c`, permanent run `31265107597`, 681/681 tests, deterministic builds, root/deployable equality, exact manifest identity, focused physical retest and explicit owner merge approval. Parser repair, offline-shell/service-worker support and atomic-state work remain separate proposals.

## Next investigation — Data Architecture D1

**Status:** investigation/design only after DTR-1; implementation is not pre-approved.

**Objective:** define the correct historical and live data platform for Teamsheet. Compare Cloudflare D1, KV, R2, Durable Objects and Google Sheets against retention, query, update, cost, reliability, privacy, export and iPhone-operation requirements. Treat the existing Sheets as field prototypes; classify each field as persist, derive, export or remove. Google Sheets is a potential human-readable reporting/analysis layer, not an assumed core database.

**Boundary:** do not repair Understat or Odds, change providers/calculations, implement storage or migrate AI during the investigation. Present a field contract, architecture options, trade-offs, fallbacks, security and implementation approval gate first.

## Deferred live-evidence checkpoint — First live evidence and Leagues acceptance

**Status:** evidence-gated, not an implementation approval.

**Objective:** test the paths that pre-season Official FPL data cannot exercise.

**Exact scope:**

- execute the deferred Leagues script using published rank and standings;
- verify real movement, points gaps, nearby rivals, pairwise comparison and explicitly loaded selected-rival exposure;
- exercise relevant targeted pagination and stale/incomplete public-picks handling;
- confirm Stage 10 outcome capture and Official FPL `data_checked` handling;
- record observed defects without changing calculations.

**Exclusions:** projected League strategy, model tuning, new providers, full-league fan-out and synthetic closure of unavailable data paths.

**Risks:** provisional or corrected Official FPL facts could be mistaken for an app defect.

**Dependencies:** a completed Gameweek, official checking and a relevant connected League membership.

**Test requirements:** existing suite plus redacted fixture shapes for each real defect before a correction is approved.

**Physical acceptance:** all items in [Leagues pre-season acceptance](LEAGUES-PRESEASON-ACCEPTANCE.md), plus a weekly Team/Transfers/Fixtures smoke check.

**Approval gate:** investigation report first; every correction receives its own scope and approval.

## Proposed product checkpoint — Weekly action and primary navigation

**Status:** after live weekly use, not approved.

**Objective:** decide whether Fixtures remains a fifth primary destination and make the most important weekly action easier to identify.

**Why it matters:** current code and the approved 31 July blueprint use five tabs, while later product direction names Team, Transfers, Leagues and Settings. This is a product decision, not evidence that Fixtures is defective.

**Exact scope:** compare five-tab, contextual Fixtures and nested Fixtures wireflows; review the dormant hosted Ask affordance; prototype one honest weekly action summary while preserving every accepted capability.

**Exclusions:** model, provider, projected-rank or strategy changes.

**Risks:** hiding fixture planning, overloading Team, breaking route/back/focus behaviour or presenting projections as certainty.

**Dependencies:** real weekly usage evidence and Pritesh's explicit information-architecture choice.

**Test requirements:** routes, aliases, focus, dock, Settings and every feature entry point.

**Physical acceptance:** complete one-handed primary-navigation workflow on iPhone Safari.

**Approval gate:** approve the wireflow and exact wording before code.

## Proposed evidence checkpoint — Prospective calibration review

**Status:** after several completed Gameweeks; evaluation only.

**Objective:** assess expected points, expected minutes, captaincy, squad decisions and transfer horizons without automatic tuning.

**Exact scope:** approved metrics by relevant segment; probability reliability; frozen decision versus outcome; completed transfer horizons; provider-state comparison with existing safeguards.

**Exclusions:** automatic model updates, retrospective cherry-picking, small-sample accuracy claims and formula changes hidden inside analysis.

**Risks:** clustered samples, revised outcomes, incomplete horizons and observational provider comparisons.

**Dependencies:** enough immutable pre-deadline snapshots, complete/corrected outcomes and retained evidence.

**Test requirements:** evidence identity, schedule alignment, correction revision and deterministic export contracts.

**Physical acceptance:** review/export readability only; formula acceptance remains a separate model gate.

**Approval gate:** evidence report first. Every proposed input or formula change requires the full model approval package.

## Proposed later checkpoint — Google Sheets archive automation

**Status:** later, not approved.

**Objective:** create an idempotent downstream season archive after the manual export schema survives live use.

**Exact scope:** map existing review/export tables, append after official completion, append corrections without duplicating identities and retain manual export fallback.

**Exclusions:** Sheets as a live application database, model feedback, client-side OAuth secrets and dependency of weekly recommendations on Drive availability.

**Risks:** duplicate rows, partial writes, OAuth/token exposure, formula injection, quota failures and schema drift.

**Dependencies:** stable export schemas plus approved authentication, ownership, retention and cost design.

**Test requirements:** schema, idempotency, revision, injection, retry and fallback coverage.

**Physical acceptance:** export/sync status on iPhone and direct review of the target Sheet by Pritesh.

**Approval gate:** provider/security/cost proposal before implementation.

## Proposed later checkpoint — Cited football-news intelligence pilot

**Status:** later, shadow evaluation only unless separately promoted.

**Objective:** test whether predicted line-ups, press-conference news and non-Premier-League congestion materially improve expected-minutes decisions.

**Exact scope:** source/licensing review; provenance and freshness; player/team identity mapping; deterministic rest/congestion fields; citation-backed AI summary; prospective shadow capture and ablation.

**Exclusions:** uncited rumours, direct AI probability overrides, autonomous tuning and recommendation changes before evidence.

**Risks:** licensing, misinformation, late team-news changes, false confidence, cost and identity errors.

**Dependencies:** an approved provider/data contract and enough prospective outcomes.

**Test requirements:** schema, provenance, stale/contradiction fallback, identity mapping, ablation and reviewed golden examples.

**Physical acceptance:** explanation clarity, source visibility and degraded-state honesty if promoted into the product.

**Approval gate:** approve source and shadow evaluation first; separately approve any effect on recommendations.

## Deliberately deferred

- framework or package-manager migration;
- mass source/test/document directory moves;
- generated root/dist redesign;
- projection, scoring, fixture or simulation consolidation without numeric identity evidence;
- transfer optimiser rewrite or removal of the independent oracle;
- Mini-League migration-key removal without a deprecation plan;
- broad CSS/component abstraction;
- automatic AI tuning or unvalidated new providers;
- tactical protect/balanced/chase recommendations without a separately validated strategy model.

## Completed foundation summary

Stages 1–10.5, Teamsheet 2.0.1–2.0.7, the Official FPL gateway, exact persistent Transfers, UX-A1, UX-A2, Team populated acceptance, Fixtures populated acceptance, the Leagues pre-season checkpoint, Repository Truth A1, Safe Hygiene A2 and Refresh-Load R1 are complete and merged. Their exact records remain in the repository history and [Historical Records](HISTORICAL_RECORDS.md); they are not open implementation work.
